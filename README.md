# AI Agent Building Guide

A comprehensive guide for building AI agents using modern tools and frameworks.

## Project Overview

This project provides educational resources, tutorials, and code examples to help developers understand and implement AI agents for specific tasks.  
The content is organized as a set of HTML pages with a shared CSS stylesheet, offering a responsive design, modern UI, and code examples with explanations.

## Getting Started

To get started with building AI agents, follow the guide for setting up a development environment in the "environment-setup.html" page.  
This guide will help you set up your environment and get ready to start building AI agents.

You can view the live version of this guide at: [https://adhin37.github.io/AI-course/](https://adhin37.github.io/AI-course/)

## GitHub Pages Hosting

This project is hosted using GitHub Pages, which allows you to host websites directly from a GitHub repository.  
The live site is automatically updated whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. This provides an easy way to share your documentation with others without needing a separate hosting service.

To set up GitHub Pages for your own project:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
3. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually main or master)
4. Choose the folder (/ (root) or /docs)
5. Click Save

Your site will be available at `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

## CSS Structure

The project uses a single consolidated CSS file (`style.css`) with the following key components:

- **Color Variables**: Consistent color scheme throughout the site
- **Layout Components**: Flexible containers, grids, and responsive elements
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons, tabs, and navigation components
- **Code Display**: Styled code blocks with proper formatting
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries for different screen sizes

### CSS Variables

```css
:root {
    --primary: #4F46E5;      /* Primary brand color (indigo) */
    --primary-dark: #4338CA; /* Darker shade of primary */

    --gray: #6B7280;         /* Gray text color */
    --light-gray: #E5E7EB;   /* Light gray for borders */
    --code-bg: #2D3748;      /* Background for code blocks */
    --code-text: #E2E8F0;    /* Text color for code */
}
